# ParallelMergeSort

Merge sort done using fork and pipe (very inefficient, just for funzies)

Compile using the given Makefile.

Providing an integer command line argument to pSort will create an array with n elements, with n being the number specified. 
No command line argument will give the user the option to enter their own array.

Enjoy!
